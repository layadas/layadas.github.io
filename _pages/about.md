I am a systems scientist. I work on estimation, control and data analysis for health monitoring and operation of complex systems.
I have worked on monitoring and control of simulated, lab-scale and real-life systems.

My approach towards understanding, modeling, monitoring and controlling complex systems includes accounting for interactions between individual units.
For example, I employed Mahalanobis distance to account for interactions between control loops in a multivaiate system.
I am presently studying the interactions between utiltarian agents with entropy and cross-entropy.

In addition to my thesis, I have collaborated on a range of interesting problems in Cognitive Engineering and Smart Grid.
In each of these applications, we exploit domain knowledge and extract information from data to efficiently solve problems.

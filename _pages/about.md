I am a systems scientist. I work on estimation, control and data analysis for health monitoring and operation of complex systems.
I have worked on monitoring and control of simulated, lab-scale and real-life systems.

My approach towards understanding, modeling, monitoring and controlling complex systems includes accounting for interactions between individual units.
For example, I employed Mahalanobis distance to account for interactions between control loops in a [multivariate system](https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2015.2468087).
I am presently studying the interactions between utiltarian agents with entropy and cross-entropy.

In addition to my thesis, I have collaborated on a range of interesting problems in [Cognitive Engineering](https://doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b03971) and
[Smart Grid](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113966).
In each of these applications, we exploit domain knowledge and extract information from data to efficiently solve problems.

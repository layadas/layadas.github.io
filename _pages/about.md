I am a systems scientist. I work on *estimation, control and data analysis for health monitoring and control of complex systems*.

My approach towards understanding, modeling, monitoring and controlling complex systems places emphasis on accounting for interactions between individual units. I have worked on a
range of interdisciplinary problems in industrial control systems, cognitive engineering and smart Grid. In each of these applications, we exploit domain knowledge and extract
information from data to efficiently solve problems.

At times of leisure, I like to imagine the geometry of dynamics. Outside of academics, I play badminton, the tabla and TPS games.

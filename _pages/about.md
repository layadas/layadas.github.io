I am a Systems scientist - my research is focussed on quantifying the performance of systems.

I have worked on health monitoring of systems ranging from Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells to Control and Estimation algorithms.
Techniques that I typically use for performance quantification include signal processing, time series analysis, compressive sensing and the like.

I am a systems scientist. I work on *estimation, control and data analysis for health monitoring and control of complex systems*.

I obtained my PhD in Electrical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar in 2018. I am presently a post-doctoral research scientist at Columbia University.

My approach towards understanding, modeling, monitoring and controlling complex systems places emphasis on accounting for interactions between individual units. I have worked on a
range of interdisciplinary problems in industrial control systems, cognitive engineering and smart grid. In each of these applications, I exploit domain knowledge and extract
information from data to efficiently solve problems.

At times of leisure, I like to imagine the geometry of dynamics. Outside of academics, I play badminton, the tabla and TPS games.

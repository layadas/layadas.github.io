My work focuses on merging domain knowledge and information extracted from data to solve interesting problems, with a broader aim of
***understanding, monitoring and controlling complex systems***. In the engineering fields, these complex systems are typically ***cyber-physical systems***.

### Performance Assessment of Estimation and Control in Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems
Industrial plants such as Tata's steel manufacturing plant or Intel's chip manufacturing plant contain thousands of control loops. It is imperative the control loops perform
as desired to ensure the quality of product. These control loops typically depend on state estimation for calculating the control moves. My PhD thesis was targeted at quantifying
the performance of state estimation and control in a manufacturing plant/unit, with several variables interacting with each other.
- In order to make the approach independent of confounding factors, I employed predictability as a measure of performance
- In order to accoutn for interactions between the different variables, I employed the Mahalanobis distance to develop a single performance metric of the systems
- In order to automate the approach, I employed a data mining approach to extract prior knowledge about the system from data

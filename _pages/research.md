My work focuses on merging domain knowledge and information extracted from data to solve interesting problems, with a broader aim of
*understanding, monitoring and controlling complex systems*. These somplex systems of interest in the engineering fields are typically *cyber-physical systems*.
My thesis focused on estimation and control in an industrial context, while collaborative applications have been on smart grid and water distribution networks.

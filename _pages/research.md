My work focuses on merging domain knowledge and information extracted from data to solve interesting problems, with a broader aim of
***understanding, monitoring and controlling complex systems***. In the engineering fields, these complex systems are typically ***cyber-physical systems***, such as smart grid,
transportation network and industrial control systems.

### Performance Assessment of Estimation and Control in Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems
Industrial plants that manufacture say, steel or electronic chips contain thousands of control loops. These control loops typically depend on state estimation for calculating the
control moves. It is imperative the control loops perform as desired to ensure the quality of product. My PhD thesis was targeted at quantifying the performance of state estimation
and control in a manufacturing plant/unit, with several variables interacting with each other.
- In order to make the approach independent of confounding factors, I employed predictability as a measure of performance
- In order to accoutn for interactions between the different variables, I proposed the Mahalanobis distance for developing a single performance metric of the systems
- In order to automate the approach, I employed a data mining approach to extract prior knowledge about the system from data

### Data Management in Smart Grid
In a smart grid, power consumption data is collected at consuming nodes and communicated to data processing centres for analysis. A back-of-the-hand calculation revleas that sizable
city like Chennai can generate 3 TB of data in as much time as a day to a fortnight, depending on the sampling rate, and communicating and storing such data is a challenging affair. I
worked collaboratively on compressing this data to a mangeable volume with signal processing and machine learning.
- In order to account for temporally varying properties of power consumption data, we proposed a dynamic compressed sensing approach for data compression
- In order to account for locality-based similarities in consumption patterns, we proposed PCA along with compressed sensing to perform spatio-temporal compression
- In order to improve the compression ratio, I employed autoencoders to perform nonlinear compression of the consumption data
